Silver Eagle - Assembly Line Analysis and Enhancement using R. @chaitalis12 + misc. project members

• Silver Eagle is company for manufacturing TP 60 trailers for UPS. Currently they were able to manufacture 3 trailers per day. 
• They were facing problems for workers allocation, slack time, etc. So, we studied their entire Assembly line and provided solutions on re-calculating man-hours at each station. 
• Also, there was addition of only 3 more workers and re-allocation of existing workers at the assembly line. 
• This resulted in reduction of their slack time and production was increased from 3 to 4 trailers (33.33%) per day.
